There are unit tests in `./tests/` that can be executed using [Gut](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut). To run them, open the project in the Godot editor, click on the GUT tab at the bottom of the window, and then click Run All.
You can also run them from the command line by running `gut.bat` in Windows or `./gut.sh` in Linux, macOS, and BSD.
